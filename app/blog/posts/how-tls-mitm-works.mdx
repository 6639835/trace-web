# How TLS MITM Works in Trace

Understanding how Trace intercepts HTTPS traffic is essential for effective debugging and understanding when certificate pinning will prevent inspection. This post explains the technical details of TLS man-in-the-middle (MITM) inspection.

## The problem: HTTPS is encrypted

When your app makes an HTTPS request, the traffic is encrypted end-to-end between your app and the server. This is great for security but problematic for debugging—you can't see request or response bodies without breaking the encryption.

Traditional network tools use packet capture (like tcpdump or Wireshark), but these only show encrypted bytes. To inspect HTTPS, you need to decrypt it.

## How MITM works

Man-in-the-middle (MITM) inspection works by inserting a proxy between your app and the destination server. The proxy:

1. Accepts the TLS connection from your app
2. Establishes a separate TLS connection to the actual server
3. Decrypts traffic from your app, inspects it, then re-encrypts and forwards it to the server
4. Does the reverse for responses

The challenge is getting your app to trust the proxy's certificate instead of rejecting it as invalid.

## Trace's certificate authority

Trace implements an on-device certificate authority (CA) that generates certificates dynamically:

### Root CA generation

On first launch, Trace generates a root CA certificate and private key. This root CA is stored securely in the App Group container. The root certificate is what you install in iOS Settings > General > VPN & Device Management.

### Dynamic certificate generation

When your app connects to `api.example.com`, Trace:

1. Checks if a certificate for `api.example.com` already exists in its cache
2. If not, generates a new certificate signed by the Trace root CA
3. The generated certificate includes the correct Subject Alternative Name (SAN) for `api.example.com`
4. Presents this certificate to your app during the TLS handshake

Because your device trusts the Trace root CA, it trusts any certificate signed by that CA—including the dynamically generated one for `api.example.com`.

### Certificate caching

Generated certificates are cached to avoid regenerating them on every connection. The cache is stored in the App Group container and persists across app launches.

## The TLS handshake

Here's what happens when your app makes an HTTPS request through Trace:

    end
    
    Trace-->>App: Re-encrypted Response
    App->>App: Decrypt & Use
`}
</Mermaid>

Both connections use real TLS. Trace isn't "breaking" encryption—it's acting as a trusted intermediary.

## Certificate pinning

Certificate pinning is a technique where apps refuse to trust certificates unless they match a specific expected certificate or public key. This breaks MITM inspection intentionally.

### How pinning works

Apps can pin in several ways:

- **Certificate pinning**: Only trust if the exact certificate matches
- **Public key pinning**: Only trust if the public key matches
- **CA pinning**: Only trust certificates signed by specific CAs

If an app pins to the real server's certificate, it will reject Trace's dynamically generated certificate even though iOS trusts it at the system level.

### Detecting pinning in Trace

Trace detects certificate pinning by monitoring connection failures. If a TLS handshake completes successfully but the app immediately closes the connection, Trace flags it as likely certificate pinning.

You'll see a warning icon on affected requests in the UI.

## Security implications

<ToggleList>
  <ToggleItem title="Trust is critical" defaultOpen>
    Installing the Trace root CA means your device trusts any certificate signed by it. Never
    install root CAs from untrusted sources. Trace's root CA is generated on your device and never
    leaves it.
  </ToggleItem>
  <ToggleItem title="Uninstall when done">
    When you're finished debugging, you can remove the root CA from Settings. Trace will continue to
    capture traffic, but HTTPS inspection will stop working.
  </ToggleItem>
  <ToggleItem title="Sandboxed storage">
    The root CA private key is stored in the App Group container with standard iOS app sandbox
    protections. Other apps cannot access it.
  </ToggleItem>
</ToggleList>

## Implementation details

Trace's MITM implementation uses:

- **Network.framework**: For TLS connection handling and certificate validation
- **Security.framework**: For certificate generation and trust evaluation
- **CommonCrypto**: For cryptographic operations

All certificate generation happens synchronously during the TLS handshake to avoid race conditions.

## When MITM fails

MITM inspection can fail in several scenarios:

<ToggleList>
  <ToggleItem title="Certificate pinning">
    The app explicitly validates the server's certificate or public key and rejects the
    Trace-generated certificate. This is common in banking apps, social media apps, and
    security-conscious applications.
  </ToggleItem>
  <ToggleItem title="Root CA not trusted">
    The user hasn't enabled "Full Trust" for the Trace root CA in Settings → General → About →
    Certificate Trust Settings. Without this, iOS won't trust certificates signed by Trace.
  </ToggleItem>
  <ToggleItem title="Client certificate authentication">
    The server requires the client to present a certificate (mutual TLS). Trace can't automatically
    forward client certificates without additional configuration.
  </ToggleItem>
  <ToggleItem title="Custom TLS implementations">
    Apps using non-standard TLS libraries or custom certificate validation logic may not respect
    system trust settings.
  </ToggleItem>
</ToggleList>

Trace handles these gracefully by capturing what it can (HTTP headers, connection metadata) without failing the request.

## Conclusion

TLS MITM is a powerful debugging tool when used responsibly. Understanding how it works helps you debug effectively and recognize when certificate pinning or other protections prevent inspection.
