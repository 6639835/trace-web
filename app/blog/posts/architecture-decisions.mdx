# Architecture Decisions Behind Trace

Building a network debugger for iOS involves navigating Apple's sandbox restrictions, performance constraints, and privacy requirements. This post explores the key architectural decisions behind Trace and the trade-offs we made.

## Network Extension vs packet capture

The fundamental question: How do you capture network traffic on iOS?

### Option 1: Packet capture (rejected)

iOS doesn't provide packet capture APIs for third-party apps. Even with a Network Extension, you can't capture raw packets from other apps like you can with tcpdump on macOS.

Why not: API doesn't exist, would require jailbreak.

### Option 2: VPN (rejected)

A VPN can route all traffic through your app, but VPNs on iOS have limitations:

- Users can only have one VPN active at a time
- Conflicts with corporate VPNs, personal VPNs, or other debugging tools
- "VPN" in the status bar creates user confusion
- VPN profiles require MDM or manual installation

Why not: Poor user experience, conflicts with existing VPNs.

### Option 3: Network Extension packet tunnel (chosen)

`NEPacketTunnelProvider` is designed for VPN implementations, but can also be used in "proxy-only" mode where you configure system proxy settings without routing all IP traffic.

Why this works:

- System-level proxy configuration captures traffic from apps that honor proxies
- No conflict with VPNs (proxies and VPNs coexist)
- Clean activation UI (iOS handles permission prompts)
- Runs in a separate process with elevated privileges

**Trade-off**: Only captures traffic from apps that respect system proxy settings. Apps that bypass the proxy (using custom networking, ignoring proxy configs) won't be captured.

This is acceptable because the vast majority of apps use `URLSession` or similar APIs that honor system settings.

## App Group storage

The app and Network Extension run in separate processes and sandboxes. They need shared storage for:

- Captured requests and responses
- Configuration (rewrite rules, scripts, etc.)
- The root CA certificate and private key

### Why App Groups?

App Groups provide a shared container accessible to both the app and extension:

```swift
let container = FileManager.default.containerURL(
    forSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier: "group.com.trace"
)
```

Both processes can read and write to this container. We use it for:

- **SQLite database**: Stores captured requests, responses, and metadata
- **Configuration files**: JSON files for rules, maps, scripts
- **Certificate storage**: Root CA and generated certificates
- **Temporary files**: Large request/response bodies

**Trade-off**: No built-in synchronization. We handle concurrent access with SQLite's built-in locking and careful file coordination.

## Two-process architecture

### Network Extension process

The extension runs continuously when capture is active:

- Receives all proxied traffic from iOS
- Performs TLS MITM if enabled
- Applies rewrite rules and request maps
- Writes captured data to the shared database
- Forwards traffic to destination servers

This process is resource-constrained—iOS can terminate it if it uses too much memory or CPU.

### Main app process

The main app:

- Provides the UI for viewing captures
- Reads from the shared database
- Allows configuration of rules and settings
- Manages the extension lifecycle (start/stop)

**Trade-off**: Two processes mean two memory budgets, but also isolation—if the UI crashes, capture continues.

## Database design

We use SQLite for structured capture data:

### Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE requests (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    url TEXT,
    method TEXT,
    status_code INTEGER,
    timestamp REAL,
    body_path TEXT,
    ...
);

CREATE TABLE headers (
    request_id INTEGER,
    name TEXT,
    value TEXT,
    is_request INTEGER,
    ...
);
```

Bodies are stored as separate files (referenced by `body_path`) to avoid SQLite's size limits and memory pressure.

**Trade-off**: File I/O overhead vs memory efficiency. We chose memory efficiency because iOS aggressively terminates memory-heavy extensions.

## SwiftUI for UI

The app is built entirely in SwiftUI:

- Declarative UI matches iOS platform conventions
- Built-in state management with `@State` and `@Observable`
- Native performance and animations
- Easier to maintain than UIKit for this use case

**Trade-off**: Some advanced UI patterns (like virtualized lists for 10,000+ items) are harder in SwiftUI. We'll optimize if this becomes a bottleneck.

## Certificate generation strategy

Dynamically generating certificates during TLS handshakes introduces latency. How do we minimize it?

### Approach 1: Generate on-demand (chosen)

Generate certificates when first needed, cache them:

```swift
func getCertificate(for host: String) -> SecCertificate {
    if let cached = certificateCache[host] {
        return cached
    }
    let cert = generateCertificate(for: host)
    certificateCache[host] = cert
    return cert
}
```

**Trade-off**: First connection to a domain is slightly slower (50-100ms), but subsequent connections are fast.

### Approach 2: Pre-generate (rejected)

Pre-generate certificates for common domains on app launch.

Why not: Can't predict which domains users will access. Would waste CPU and storage.

## Why Swift Package Manager?

Trace is structured as multiple SPM modules:

- **TraceCore**: Shared models and utilities
- **TraceProxy**: Proxy server and MITM logic
- **TraceExtension**: Network Extension provider
- **TraceApp**: SwiftUI app

### Benefits

- Clear module boundaries prevent accidental coupling
- Faster incremental builds (only changed modules rebuild)
- Easier to test individual modules
- Potential for code reuse in future macOS or iPadOS variants

**Trade-off**: More boilerplate for module setup, but better long-term maintainability.

## Performance optimizations

### Lazy body loading

Large request/response bodies aren't loaded into memory until the user taps to view them:

```swift
struct RequestDetail: View {
    let request: Request
    @State private var body: Data?

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // ... headers, metadata ...
            if let body = body {
                BodyView(body)
            }
        }
        .task {
            body = await loadBody(request.bodyPath)
        }
    }
}
```

### Database indexing

Indexes on common query patterns:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_timestamp ON requests(timestamp);
CREATE INDEX idx_url ON requests(url);
CREATE INDEX idx_status ON requests(status_code);
```

### Background processing

Non-critical work (like calculating request size stats) happens on background queues to keep the UI responsive.

## What didn't work

Some approaches we tried and abandoned:

### In-memory capture storage

Initially, we stored captures in memory (arrays of structs). This was simple but caused memory pressure in the extension, leading to termination by iOS.

**Lesson**: Always use persistent storage for unbounded data in Network Extensions.

### Shared memory via XPC

We tried using XPC for fast communication between processes. It worked but added complexity without meaningful performance gains over database polling.

**Lesson**: Simpler is better. SQLite as a message queue is good enough.

### Custom binary protocol for storage

We experimented with a custom binary format for captures instead of SQLite. It was faster but much harder to debug and query.

**Lesson**: Use proven tools. SQLite's query capabilities are worth the slight overhead.

## Lessons learned

1. **iOS will terminate your extension**: Design for minimal memory usage
2. **Debugging extensions is hard**: Invest in logging infrastructure early
3. **Users won't read documentation**: Make the UI self-explanatory
4. **Certificate trust is confusing**: Provide step-by-step visual guides
5. **Performance matters**: Even a debugging tool needs to be fast

## Future improvements

Areas we're actively working on:

- **Memory optimization**: Handle sessions with 10,000+ requests without slowdown
- **Better filtering**: Complex queries with AND/OR logic
- **Export formats**: Postman collections, Paw files
- **Collaborative features**: Share sessions with annotations

## Conclusion

Architectural decisions are always trade-offs. Trace prioritizes:

1. Privacy (on-device, no telemetry)
2. Reliability (crash-resistant two-process design)
3. Compatibility (works with existing VPNs)
4. Performance (efficient storage, lazy loading)

The result is a tool that works well within iOS's constraints while providing the features developers need.
