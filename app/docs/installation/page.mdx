# Installation

Install Trace and complete the initial setup for capture.

## System requirements

- **iOS version**: iOS 16.0 or later
- **Device**: physical iPhone or iPad
- **Storage**: enough free space for capture data (requests, bodies, exports)

<Info>Network Extension packet tunnels do not work in the iOS simulator.</Info>

## Initial setup

### 1. Grant VPN permission

1. Launch Trace.
2. Approve the system prompt to add a VPN configuration.
3. Authenticate with Face ID/Touch ID or passcode.

<Info>This VPN configuration is local-only and routes traffic to the on-device proxy.</Info>

### 2. Install and trust the root CA (optional)

To decrypt HTTPS traffic, install and trust the Trace root certificate.

1. In Trace, go to **Settings → Certificate** and tap **Install Certificate**.
2. In iOS Settings, install the profile.
3. Enable trust under **Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings**.

<Tip>
  You can remove the profile and trust at any time. Without it, HTTPS bodies remain encrypted.
</Tip>

### 3. Verify capture

- Start capture from **Network**.
- Confirm the VPN indicator appears.
- Load a page in Safari and verify requests appear.

## Optional settings you may want

- **Disable body capture** if you only need headers and timing.
- **Set a max body size** to avoid large payloads filling storage.
- **Enable favorites** or tags for requests you want to track over time.

## Uninstall or reset

- Remove the Trace profile from **Settings → General → VPN & Device Management**.
- Disable trust under **Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings**.
- Delete the app to remove all on-device captures.

## Troubleshooting

- **No requests appear**: Ensure capture is started and the VPN indicator is visible.
- **HTTPS bodies are empty**: Confirm the root CA is installed and trusted.
- **Simulator**: Capture does not work in the simulator.
