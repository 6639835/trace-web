# Quick start guide

Get capturing in a few minutes. This guide follows the actual Trace flow: VPN permission, optional CA trust, and your first request.

## Prerequisites

- iOS 16.0 or later
- Trace installed on a physical iPhone or iPad

<Info>
  Network Extension packet tunnels do not run in the iOS simulator.
</Info>

## Step 1: Grant VPN permission

When Trace first launches, iOS prompts to add a VPN configuration. This is required for capture.

1. Tap **Allow** on the system dialog.
2. Authenticate with Face ID/Touch ID or passcode.
3. When capture is active, you will see the VPN indicator in the status bar.

<Info>
  The VPN is local-only and routes traffic to the on-device proxy. Your traffic never leaves the device.
</Info>

## Step 2: Install and trust the root CA (optional)

To decrypt HTTPS bodies, install and trust the Trace root certificate.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Install Profile">
    1. Open Trace and go to **Settings → Certificate**.
    2. Tap **Install Certificate**.
    3. iOS Settings opens a profile install screen.
    4. Tap **Install** and confirm.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Enable Trust">
    1. Go to **Settings → General → About**.
    2. Tap **Certificate Trust Settings**.
    3. Enable **Trace Root CA** and confirm.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  If you skip this step, Trace still captures request metadata but cannot decrypt HTTPS bodies.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Start capture

1. Open Trace and go to **Network**.
2. Tap **Start Capture**.
3. Use any app and return to Trace to see live requests.

## Step 4: Verify HTTPS inspection (optional)

1. Open any HTTPS page in Safari.
2. Inspect a request body.
3. If the body is empty, confirm the root CA is trusted in Settings.

## Step 4: Inspect a request

1. Tap a request in the list.
2. Review **Overview**, **Headers**, **Body**, **Timing**, and **Certificate** (HTTPS).

<Tip>
  Large bodies are stored on disk and may be truncated in the UI. Use export if you need the full payload.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Filter traffic

Open **Filters** to narrow results. You can:

- Filter by domains (supports wildcards)
- Filter by method or status code
- Filter by content type
- Toggle quick filters (errors, favorites, duplicates)
- Save filter presets for reuse

## Step 6: Save and share a session

1. Open the session menu in **Network**.
2. Export as **HAR** or copy a request as **cURL**.
3. Share using the iOS Share Sheet.

<Info>
  Use HAR for full-session context. Use cURL when you need a single request you can replay quickly.
