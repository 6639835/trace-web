# API reference (high level)

Trace does not expose a public SDK, but contributors can use this map of core modules and types.

## Core modules

- **TraceCore**: shared models, App Group storage, logging
- **TraceNetworking**: HTTP/HTTP2/WebSocket/SSE parsing
- **TraceSecurity**: certificate management and TLS helpers
- **TraceProxy**: MITM proxy server and connection handling
- **TracePacket**: packet parsing and reassembly
- **TraceFeatures**: higher-level features (rewrite, maps, scripts, breakpoints)
- **TraceUI**: reusable UI components

## Common types

- `AppGroupStorage`: shared storage for requests, sessions, and configuration
- `CaptureConfiguration` / `CaptureMode`: capture settings and proxy modes
- `VPNManager`: manages VPN lifecycle and IPC with the extension
- `MITMProxyServer`: local proxy for HTTP/HTTPS
- `CertificateManager`: root CA generation and validation

## Configuration surfaces

- **Capture settings**: mode, body size limits, and filters
- **Rules and scripts**: rewrite rules, request maps, and scripting config
- **Export**: session and request exporters

## Working with requests

Requests are captured in the extension, stored in the App Group container, and surfaced in the app through the `TraceCore` models. Use the storage layer rather than direct file access.

## Extension boundary

Anything in `TraceVPN` runs in a separate process. Use NEAppMessages and App Group storage for communication and state.

## Adding a new feature

1. Define models in `TraceCore` if you need shared storage.
2. Add capture-time behavior in `TraceVPN` or `TraceProxy` as needed.
3. Expose UI in `TraceUI` and wire feature toggles in `TraceFeatures`.
