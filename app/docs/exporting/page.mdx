# Exporting sessions

Trace provides multiple ways to export traffic and configuration artifacts.

## HAR export and import

From the Network screen menu, you can:

- **Export HAR**: save the current session as a HAR file
- **Import HAR**: load a HAR file and view it inside Trace

HAR is the best format for sharing complete sessions with teammates or desktop tools.

## cURL import and copy

- **Copy as cURL** from a request detail or list action
- **Import cURL** from the Network toolbar to replay a request

## Share request and body data

Each request supports sharing:

- Full request summary
- Request body
- Response body

Trace chooses a suitable file type for the body based on content type.

## Export configuration

From the relevant settings screens, you can export and share:

- Rewrite rules
- Request maps
- Scripts
- Hosts entries

## DNS and UDP exports

If you capture DNS or UDP flows, Trace can export them as CSV or JSON from their respective screens.

## Privacy and data handling

- Review exports before sharing outside your team.
- Remove sensitive headers (tokens, cookies) when needed.
- Prefer smaller, filtered sessions to reduce exposure.

## Large sessions

- Export a single session rather than the entire history.
- Clear older sessions after you have captured the data you need.

<Info>Exports use the iOS Share Sheet, so you control where the data goes.</Info>
