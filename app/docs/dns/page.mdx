# DNS inspector

Trace can capture and inspect DNS queries and responses when DNS traffic passes through the tunnel.

## View DNS traffic

- DNS messages appear in the DNS list when capture is active.
- Use search and filters to isolate domains or record types.

## Export DNS data

1. Open the DNS list.
2. Tap **Export**.
3. Choose CSV or JSON.

## Notes

- DNS is usually UDP-based. In proxy-only mode, DNS traffic is not captured.
- Use full-tunnel mode when you need DNS visibility.
