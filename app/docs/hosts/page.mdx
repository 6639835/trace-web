# Host overrides

Host overrides let you map a hostname to a custom IP address (and optional port), similar to an on-device hosts file.

## Common use cases

- Point production domains to a staging server.
- Test a new backend without changing client code.
- Override DNS resolution for debugging.

## Create a host entry

1. Open **Settings → Hosts**.
2. Tap **Add Host**.
3. Enter the **Hostname** (wildcards supported).
4. Enter the **Target IP** and optional **Port**.
5. Save and enable the entry.

## Notes

- Host overrides apply only while capture is active.
- Use distinct names to keep entries organized.
- Disable or delete overrides when you are done to avoid confusion.
