# Certificate pinning

Some apps use certificate pinning or custom trust logic. In these cases, HTTPS MITM will fail and Trace will fall back to passthrough.

## What you will see

- The request appears, but the body may be empty or encrypted.
- The Certificate tab shows the original server certificate.
- The connection may fail if the app rejects the MITM certificate.

## What you can do

- **Disable HTTPS inspection** for that app or host if you only need metadata.
- **Use full-tunnel mode** to capture more context, then analyze with exports.
- **Use a debug build** of the app with pinning disabled (recommended for internal apps).

<Tip>
  Pinning is a security feature. Only bypass it when you have explicit permission to do so.
