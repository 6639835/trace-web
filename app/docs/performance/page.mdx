# Performance tuning

Trace is built to run on-device, but large captures can still consume CPU, memory, and storage. Use these settings to keep captures efficient.

## Reduce capture size

- **Disable body capture** when you only need headers and timing.
- **Lower max body size** to avoid large payloads filling storage.
- **Clear sessions** regularly if you are running long tests.

## Session management

- Capture only the flows you need, then stop capture.
- Use a new session per test run to keep data grouped.

## Use filters early

Apply domain, method, and status filters to reduce UI load and indexing overhead.

## Prefer proxy-only mode

Proxy-only mode has less overhead than full-tunnel routing. Use full-tunnel only when needed.

## Throttling and diagnostics

- Use throttling profiles only when you need network simulation.
- Disable raw packet capture when not actively debugging low-level issues.

## Device considerations

- Keep the device plugged in for long capture sessions.
- Close other apps to reduce background contention.

## When to restart

If the capture list becomes sluggish, stop capture, export what you need, then clear the session and restart.
