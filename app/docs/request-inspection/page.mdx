# Request inspection

Inspect any captured request in Trace with headers, bodies, timing, and TLS details.

## Overview

Tap a request in the Network list to open the inspector.

<Info>
  **Inspector tabs:**
  - **Overview**: summary, status, size, and timing
  - **Headers**: request and response headers
  - **Body**: request/response bodies with format-aware viewers
  - **Timing**: DNS, connect, TLS, and transfer breakdown
  - **Certificate**: TLS chain details (HTTPS only)
</Info>

## Overview tab

The Overview tab shows core metadata:

```
GET /api/items
Host: api.example.com
Status: 200 OK
Size: 12.4 KB
Duration: 184 ms
```

Common fields include:

- **Protocol**: HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2
- **Remote address**: server IP and port
- **Connection**: keep-alive, close, or upgrade
- **Timestamp**: when the request started

## Headers tab

Browse request and response headers in a searchable table.

<Tip>
  Use copy/share actions to export the header set for debugging.
</Tip>

## Body tab details

Trace chooses a viewer based on the content type and payload:

- **Pretty-print** JSON and XML
- **Syntax highlight** common text formats
- **Inline preview** for images and SVG
- **Raw view** when the body is binary or unknown

## Body tab

Trace renders bodies with format-aware viewers:

- JSON, XML, and HTML
- Images and SVG
- Form and multipart data
- Plain text and binary detection

Large bodies may be truncated in the UI; export for full payloads.

## Timing tab

The timing breakdown helps identify slow steps:

- **DNS**
- **Connect**
- **TLS**
- **Request**
- **Wait (TTFB)**
- **Response**

## Certificate tab (HTTPS only)

Inspect the TLS chain and certificate fingerprint. This is useful for debugging trust issues and pinning.

## Filtering requests

Use the **Filters** panel to narrow results:

- Domains (wildcards supported)
- HTTP method
- Status code
- Content type
- Quick filters (errors, favorites, duplicates)

## Debugging workflow example

1. Filter by domain and status.
2. Open a request and confirm headers.
3. Inspect the response body for errors or schema changes.
4. Export as cURL or HAR if you need to share.
