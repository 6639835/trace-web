# Sessions

Sessions group captured traffic so you can keep test runs separate and easier to export.

## Use sessions in the Network list

- Start a new session before a test run.
- Switch sessions to focus on a specific capture.
- Group the list by session for a timeline of runs.

## Tips

- Name sessions by feature or test case.
- Export a single session to keep shared files small.
