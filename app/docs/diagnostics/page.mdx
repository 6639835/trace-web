# Diagnostics and logs

Trace includes diagnostics tools to help with low-level troubleshooting and support cases.

## Packet captures (PCAP)

1. Open **Settings → Packet Captures**.
2. Review capture files created during raw packet capture.
3. Share or delete files as needed.

PCAP files can be opened in tools like Wireshark.

## Event logs

Trace records structured logs for the app and network extension. These logs are stored on-device and can be reviewed when debugging issues or sharing with support.

## Storage management

Use **Settings → Storage** to review space usage and clean up old requests, bodies, and logs.
