# Trace documentation

Trace is an on-device iOS network debugger that captures HTTP(S), WebSocket, and SSE traffic using a Network Extension packet tunnel. It runs a local MITM proxy, stores captures in an App Group container, and ships tools for inspection, modification, replay, and export. These docs cover how to use Trace and how to work on the codebase.

## Who this is for

- **Developers** debugging network behavior on iOS
- **QA and release engineers** validating regressions or backend changes
- **Contributors** working on the Trace app or extension

## How the docs are organized

- **Start Here**: install Trace and capture your first requests
- **Use Trace**: inspect, filter, and export sessions
- **Advanced Usage**: deeper capture modes and customization
- **Developers & Contributing**: architecture, building, and APIs

## What you will learn

- How to install and trust the Trace root CA for HTTPS inspection
- How capture modes differ and what they include
- How to inspect, filter, and export traffic
- How the system is built (app, extension, SwiftPM modules)

## Get started in 2 minutes

Prerequisites:

- iOS 16.0 or later
- A physical iPhone or iPad (Network Extension packet tunnels do not run in the simulator)

**Start capturing:**

1. Open Trace and complete onboarding (VPN permission, optional certificate trust).
2. Go to Network and tap **Start Capture**.
3. Use any app and watch requests appear.

## Key concepts

- **Proxy-only capture**: Uses system proxy settings and captures apps that honor proxy settings.
- **Full-tunnel capture**: Routes all traffic through the tunnel and forwards via a SOCKS5 server (advanced).
- **On-device MITM**: A local root CA enables HTTPS inspection when trusted.
- **Shared storage**: Captures, sessions, and config are stored in an App Group container.
