# Trace documentation overview

Trace is an on-device iOS network debugger that captures HTTP(S), WebSocket, and SSE traffic using a Network Extension packet tunnel. It runs a local MITM proxy, stores captures in an App Group container, and ships tools for inspection, modification, replay, and export.

## What you will learn

- How to install and trust the Trace root CA for HTTPS inspection
- How proxy-only and full-tunnel capture modes differ
- How to inspect, filter, and export traffic
- How the system is built (app, extension, SwiftPM modules)

## Get started in 2 minutes

Prerequisites:

- iOS 16.0 or later
- A physical iPhone or iPad (Network Extension packet tunnels do not run in the simulator)

**Start capturing:**

1. Open Trace and complete onboarding (VPN permission, optional certificate trust).
2. Go to Network and tap **Start Capture**.
3. Use any app and watch requests appear.

## Key concepts

- **Proxy-only capture**: Uses system proxy settings and captures apps that honor proxy settings.
- **Full-tunnel capture**: Routes all traffic through the tunnel and forwards via a SOCKS5 server (advanced).
- **On-device MITM**: A local root CA enables HTTPS inspection when trusted.
- **Shared storage**: Captures, sessions, and config are stored in an App Group container.
