# CI/CD integration

Trace is an on-device tool, so it does not run in headless CI. Instead, use Trace exports to connect device testing with your CI/CD workflows.

## Recommended workflow

1. Reproduce the issue on device with Trace running.
2. Export the session as HAR or copy cURL requests.
3. Attach exports to CI artifacts, bug reports, or QA checklists.

## Common integration patterns

- **Regression triage**: attach HAR to failed test runs.
- **API checks**: replay cURL commands in a pipeline step.
- **Bug reports**: include a short session plus screenshots.

## Useful artifacts

- **HAR**: full session context for debugging regressions
- **cURL**: replay a single request in automation or load testing
- **Screenshots**: capture UI context alongside network evidence

## Tips

- Use consistent session names for easier lookup.
- Export only the relevant session to keep artifacts small.
