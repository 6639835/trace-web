# Breakpoints

Breakpoints pause live requests or responses so you can inspect and edit them before continuing.

## What breakpoints can do

- Pause a request before it is sent.
- Pause a response before it is displayed.
- Edit URL, method, headers, body, and status code.
- Resume or drop the request.

## Enable breakpoints

1. Open **Settings → Breakpoints**.
2. Tap **Add Breakpoint**.
3. Choose **Request** or **Response**.
4. Set a match pattern and enable the breakpoint.

## When a breakpoint triggers

- Trace presents a breakpoint editor.
- Make edits in **Overview**, **Headers**, or **Body** tabs.
- Tap **Send** to continue or **Drop** to cancel.

<Tip>Use narrow match patterns to avoid pausing too many requests at once.</Tip>
