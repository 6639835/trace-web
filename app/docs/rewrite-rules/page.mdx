# Rewrite rules

Rewrite rules let you change requests and responses on the fly before they reach the server or the UI.

## What rewrite rules can do

Use rewrite rules to:

- Redirect requests to a different URL.
- Modify request headers, query params, cookies, or body.
- Modify response headers, body, or status code.
- Block requests entirely.
- Map requests to local responses (mocking).

## Create a rule

1. Open **Settings → Rewrite Rules**.
2. Tap **Add Rule**.
3. Choose a **Rule Type** (redirect, modify, block, map).
4. Configure the **Match** criteria (exact, contains, wildcard, or regex).
5. Add one or more **Actions**.
6. Save and enable the rule.

## Matching and priority

- Rules match on the request URL.
- Use **priority** to control evaluation order.
- Enable **Stop processing** to prevent later rules from running after a match.
- Use **tags** to group and filter rules.

## Common actions

- Set or remove headers.
- Replace or set the body.
- Redirect to a new URL.
- Add delays or throttling.
- Encode/decode body content.
- Adjust status codes and connection behavior.

<Tip>
  Start with a single rule and verify it applies to one request before broadening the match pattern.
