# Certificate management

Trace performs HTTPS inspection using a local root certificate authority (CA) generated on your device. You control whether that CA is trusted.

## Install the root CA

1. In Trace, go to **Settings → Certificate**.
2. Tap **Install Certificate**.
3. iOS Settings opens a profile installation screen.
4. Tap **Install** and confirm.

## Enable full trust

1. Open **Settings → General → About**.
2. Tap **Certificate Trust Settings**.
3. Enable **Trace Root CA** and confirm.

<Info>
  Without trust enabled, Trace can still capture HTTPS metadata but cannot decrypt bodies.
</Info>

## Export or remove the certificate

- **Export**: Use the certificate screen in Trace to export the root CA for testing or device management.
- **Remove**: Delete the profile from Settings and disable trust in Certificate Trust Settings.

## Verify HTTPS inspection

1. Capture a request to any HTTPS domain.
2. Open the **Body** tab in the inspector.
3. If the body is empty, re-check trust settings or reinstall the profile.

## Multiple devices

Each device generates its own root CA. If you debug on multiple devices, repeat installation and trust on each one.

## Security guidance

- Only trust the Trace CA on devices you control.
- Remove the CA when you are done debugging.
- Apps that use certificate pinning may bypass MITM and show passthrough traffic.
