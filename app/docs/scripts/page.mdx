# Custom scripts

Trace includes a JavaScript-based scripting engine to modify requests and responses on the fly.

## What scripts can do

- Rewrite URLs or headers
- Transform request or response bodies
- Mock dynamic responses
- Apply logic that is hard to express with simple rules

## Script types

- **Request scripts**: run before the request is sent
- **Response scripts**: run after the response is received
- **Both**: run on both phases

## When to use scripts

- You need conditional logic (if/else) instead of static rules
- You need to compute a response body dynamically
- You want to prototype backend changes without deploying

## Tips

- Keep scripts small and focused for easier debugging.
- Prefer rewrite rules for simple header or URL changes.
- Export scripts to share them with teammates.
