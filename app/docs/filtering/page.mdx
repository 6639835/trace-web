# Filtering traffic

Trace includes a dedicated Filters panel to reduce noise and focus on the requests you care about.

## Open the Filters panel

From the Network screen, open **Filters** to configure capture and view filters.

## Quick filters

- **Favorites only**: show only starred requests
- **Errors only**: show HTTP 4xx/5xx responses
- **Duplicates only**: highlight repeated requests and refresh detection

## Domain filters

Add domains to include or exclude traffic.

- Supports wildcards like `*.example.com`
- Useful for focusing on a single backend

## Method and status filters

- Filter by HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
- Filter by a specific status code

## Content type filters

Filter by response content type (JSON, HTML, images, and more) to focus on a specific payload type.

## Saved presets

Save a filter configuration and reuse it later from the **Saved Presets** list.

<Tip>Combine domain + method + status filters to find a single endpoint quickly.</Tip>

## Example filters

- **Only API errors**: domain `api.example.com` + status `>= 400`
- **Images only**: content type `image/*`
- **Checkout flow**: domain `checkout.example.com` + method `POST`

## Performance tips

- Apply filters early to reduce list size.
- Save presets for repeated investigations.
